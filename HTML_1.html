    charset is a atttribute which the browser that what set of characters you will be using.
    ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .
    ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.
    ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.
    The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world! -->
